## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement strict prop types
- Document components using JSDoc
- Follow Material-UI theming guidelines

### Component Development

```typescript
// Example component structure
import React from 'react';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import type { ComponentProps } from './types';

export const MyComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};
```

### State Management

- Use Redux Toolkit for global state
- React Query for server state
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Context API for theme/localization

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Minimum 80% coverage

## Performance
